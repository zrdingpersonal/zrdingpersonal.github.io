Welcome! This is my personal website that briefly introduces myself: my experiences, my interests, etc. I am planning to apply for Ph.D. or MSc in North America. If you feel my interests or experiences interesting, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:zhaorui_ding@hust.edu.cn). Thank you for your time and attention!

If you want a listed introduction of myself, please see the "CV" page. **If you want to read my blogs, see [https://dingzr2001.github.io](https://dingzr2001.github.io)**.

Education
------

I will be graduating from the Department of Computer Science, Huazhong University of Science and Technology ([HUST](http://english.hust.edu.cn/)) in May, 2024 and receive my Bachelor's Degree in Engineering. Before that, I completed my high school in Tsinghua University High School.

## Research Interests

My research interest lies in computer systems and databases, including storage systems, anomaly detection,
resource scheduling, database indexing and partitioning, query and data processing, and their interaction with AI.
Besides, I also hold an interest in AI itself and its application. As an undergraduate student, there are many fields for me to explore.

Research Experiences
------

I have involved in research of database partitioning and indexing as a research assistant under the guidance of Professor **Hua Wang**[[DBLP]](https://dblp.org/pid/33/3535-8.html) and **Ke Zhou**[[DBLP]](https://dblp.org/pid/78/2949-1.html) at the Intelligent Data Storage and Management Laboratory ([IDSM](http://idsm.wnlo.hust.edu.cn/)), Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics ([WNLO](http://wnlo.hust.edu.cn/)), during which I worked on a system for database partitioning and indexing recommendation that aims to minimize data retrieval latency under a given storage budget. By a novel approach that combines partitioning and indexing with algorithm optimization, a system was built with _python_ which, in later experiments, proved to reduce latency by 1.14-4.04x compared with other state-of-the-art models. 

Previously, I was a research intern at the Cloud Storage Joint Research Center of HUST and Tencent. I summarized papers about storage systems, particularly AI for anomaly detection of disks and propagation of anomalies in web services. I also implemented a transfer learning model for minority disk failure prediction and ran experiments to test its performance.

Besides, I also worked as a research intern at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) (also known as Pujiang Lab) and conducted research on AI for Bioinformatics, specifically De Novo Peptide Sequencing based on Deep learning. Following the idea of image-text retrieval, I contributed to building a multi-modal deep learning model that utilized contrastive learning for learning the pattern of tandem mass spectra and their corresponding protein sequence.

Other Experiences
------

In my spare time, I have engaged in explorations in related fields. I participated in the 2023 ACM SIGMOD Programming Contest, where I delved into the construction algorithm of KNN Graph in high-dimensional spaces, a problem proposed by Microsoft. As a member of the school's competition team, I implemented two mapping methods: Locality Sensitive Hashing and KD-Tree, compared their performance and explored the effectiveness of the NN-Descent algorithm for KNNG optimization (with C++). In the end, our team achieved a recall rate of over 96% on a dataset with 10 million points, ranking seventh on the final leaderboard. Besides, I also learned cloud computing and storage at CECloud as a visiting student.

Moreover, I have participated in some team projects and developed my teamwork skills. I participated in the development of an online learning platform based on learning route, where I was responsible for front-end development, interface implementation, and some back-end development work. Together with other team members, we completed the website and deployed it onto the public network.

In addition to study and research, I also served as the Vice President of the Computer Science Student Union. In this role, I lead members in promoting college activities, including writing articles for public accounts and designing posters. This has nurtured my leadership and organizational skills. I am also passionate about sports and have joined the college's table tennis team. In school competitions, we achieved the best result in team history.

## More About Me

During my time in university, I have learned multiple programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript. Among them, I am most fond of C++ and Python for coding. In my personal life, I am an outgoing person who enjoys various sports such as running, swimming, cycling, basketball, and table tennis. I also have an interest in board games and artistic creations, including chess, Go, and photography, which add color and richness to my life.

That's briefly about me. "Life is a lucid dream", said my favorite singer Adam Young. Hope I will try my best to figure it out and make it better. Also, wish you good health and a wonderful day!
